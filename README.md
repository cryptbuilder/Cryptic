## Cryptic is perpetual data storage, management and privacy proof multiuser eSignature Dapp

### Key Features:

1. Cryptic Sign

- Multiuser eSignature to Agreements

2. Cryptic Vault

- Perpetual data Storage
- NFT based Access
- Information Inheritance
- Data Encryption on Top of IPFS

### What problem we are solving:

1. Currently we are using docusign to sign agreements digitally. But in that users personal data and agreements gets stored on the centrealised database. So here we have built cryptic sign which totally decentralised. User can add agreements with sign placeholders and then can share the link with the member of that agreement. Only added whitelisted members will be able to access the link. Members will sign the agreement using that sharabale link.

2. If something happens to a person or in case of death families are not aware of a) How much crypto person is having and especially how to get access to it b) Millions of dollars worth of insurance are unclaimed because families don't know if there was any medical insurance or life insurance. c) Property will deed etc

3. no central point of failure and censorship resistance. Currently, we store our data on Dropbox, Google Drive, etc but there are chances that someone from the internal team can access our data so we have encrypted data using SHA 256 and the encrypted hash is getting stored on IPFS

4. Persistent storage & Perpetual storage: Physical copy of data may get lost or damaged due to any reason but data stored on IPFS and Pinned using Filecoin are totally secure and everlasting. Even if the big bang happens on eath, data on the File coin will be accessible from other planets through satellite node which Protocol Labs team is planning :)
